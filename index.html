          <h3>Why choose Canada for your next vacation?</h3>
          <p>
            Canada is a land of breathtaking beauty and diverse landscapes that
            will captivate any traveler. From the rugged Rocky Mountains and
            crystal-clear lakes of British Columbia to the picturesque Atlantic
            coast and charming Quebec City, every corner offers something
            unique. Nature lovers can explore vast national parks, hike through
            pristine forests, or experience the majestic northern lights in the
            Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Canada's wilderness is home to
            incredible wildlife, including bears, moose, and whales, offering
            unforgettable outdoor adventures.
            <br />
            <br />
            For city enthusiasts, Canada's urban centers like Toronto,
            Vancouver, and Montreal offer vibrant cultures, world-class dining,
            shopping, and entertainment. Whether you're strolling through the
            cobblestone streets of Old Montreal or visiting the iconic CN Tower
            in Toronto, there's something for every taste and interest. The
            country's rich Indigenous heritage adds a fascinating layer to the
            cultural experience, with opportunities to learn from Indigenous
            communities and explore art, history, and traditions.
            <br />

            Canada is also known for its friendly and welcoming people, ensuring
            that visitors feel at home. Whether you're seeking outdoor
            adventures, exploring cosmopolitan cities, or immersing yourself in
            cultural experiences, Canada offers a diverse and enriching travel
            experience that will leave you with lifelong memories.

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi there, my name is Sai. I live in an absolutely breathtaking country
          called Canada, and I frequently find myself in awe of its beauty. Time
          outside, as simple as a short walk, helps me feel connected to nature.
          I love how the greenery claims most of Canada in the summer, the
          vibrant and crisp fall season, the winter wonderland of ice, and the
          season of renewal and blooming flowers—spring.
